# Portfolio-Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This website showcases all of my projects and provides a way for you to contact me. The website is built using ReactJS, making it responsive and efficient. The codebase includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and Bootstrap for various components. I have created this website throughout my learning journey, and all the projects are available here.

## Technologies Used

- ReactJS: The website is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React enables the creation of reusable UI components, making the website more modular and maintainable. All the components are written in JSX (JavaScript XML), a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows us to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.

- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used for styling the website, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent user experience across different devices.
